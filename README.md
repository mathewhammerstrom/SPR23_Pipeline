Code + Figures related to my SPR 23 Posters

This GitHub repo is dedicated to the two posters I presented at SPR 2023 in New Orleans, USA. This will be my first SPR, and I am super excited to share and learn.

Both posters I am presenting stem from a long-term project in my lab, the Theoretical and Applied Neuroscience Laboratory at the University of Victoria. This goal of this
project is to investigate various aspects of two commonly studied ERP components, the P300 and Reward Positivity, in a large subset of participants. As such, we have a 
data set of over 500 participants completing both a Visual Oddball and Two-Armed Bandit task to elicit these components, respectively. Our primary goal was to show the 
timing, topography, and amplitude of these ERP components in a large population, arming researchers with some idea of what they will likely look like. First, we published
our findings related to the Two-Armed Bandit task in Williams et al. (2021) The ERP, Frequency, and Time-Frequency Correlates of Feedback Processing: Insights from a Large Sample Study. 
A similar paper focused on the P300 elicited by the Visual Oddball is currently in preparation. 

The posters I present this year stem from our next phase of investigating this data. 

1) How do participant characteristics affect these components?
2) How do different analysis techniques affect how we study these components?
